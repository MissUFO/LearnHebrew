          <h1>An Introduction to <br />Ancient Hebrew</h1>
          <h2>The Ancient Hebrew Alphabet </h2>
          <p>This 4,000 year old Inscription was found in the land of <a href="">Israel</a> and is composed of three letters written in the ancient pictographic Hebrew script. The letter at the top of the inscription is the aleph and is a picture of an ox head representing strength. Below that is the letter lamed and is a picture of a shepherd staff representing authority. When these pictographs are combined the word "el" is formed meaning "the strong one of authority."</p>
          <p><img src="images/wordindex-img.png" class="left">The Hebrew Bible (called the Tenack by Jews and the <a href="">Old Testament</a> by Christians) was originally written in this pictographic Hebrew script (as well as a modified form usually refered to as <a href="">Paleo-Hebrew</a>) by Hebrews whose language and culture were very different from our own. Because of this, it is through the study of the ancient Hebrew alphabet, language and culture we can better understand the Biblical texts.</p>
